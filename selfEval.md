# Self Evaluation

- What did you struggle with in this section?
  - I think I struggled a little bit with wrapping my head around the levels of data. I had to go back into the beginning of the lesson and review how each one stores their information and what kind of information they store. After reviewing, I feel more comfortable, and surprisingly, the exercise on Objects within Arrays was very clarifying for me.
- How is note-taking going? What are you finding helpful? When do you find yourself taking the most helpful notes?
  - Note taking is going well! I'm finding that sticking to one color for code, one color for actual notes, and one color for comments within the code is really helpful so it doesn't look like a block of text. I find myself taking the most helpful notes when I'm copying down examples--that is what I refer back to when I'm missing or forgetting something.
- What are you noticing that you lean into - Googling, or trying to solve a problem in code on your own first?
  - I try to solve it within code first. I usually have a series of ideas that I will run through before thinking I might need to turn to google. I think that coming up against problems is actually more helpful for me to learn instead of jumping straight into a web search. But if all else fails, I will definitely google search so I'm not completely drowning.
